This is just a simple app I am using to learn AngularJS.

To use:
    
    1. Download repo as a .zip, or however you want.
    
    2. Unzip repo (if zipped)
    
    3. Realize it's a webapp and isn't actually hosted anywhere on the internet and get mad at me.
    
    4. E-mail me to demand that it gets hosted somewhere.
    
    5. Wait six to seven months
    
    6. Check out <insertmynewwebsitehere>.com/coinjar!
